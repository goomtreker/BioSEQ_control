# BioSeq_control

## О BioSeq_control
***Bioseq_control*** is small python program designed for parsing and processing sequences. The software consists of two modules and a primary script.
The programm has two python modules and main script.


#### Structures of files:


- **main_script.py**
- **modules_HW4**
    - **dna_rna_tools**
    - **fastq_filter_m**

### Installing

```bash
git clone git@github.com:goomtreker/BioSEQ_control.git
```
Adding modules:
Run python interpretator that you prefer
```python
import sys
sys.path.append("path/to/BioSEQ_control")
```
### Использование
The main script ```main_script``` consists of two functions:
-```run_dna_rna_tools```
-```filter_fastq```

```run_dna_rna_tool``` It accepts one or more sequences (RNA or DNA) and the last argument is taken by an agent that will be identical to the name of the function.possible functions:
- ```reverse```
- ```reverse_complement```
- ```transcribe```
- ```complement```
- ```find_possible_ORF```
- ```GC_status```
- ```check_acid_type```
Example of using:
```python
run_dna_rna_tools('GGCccttggATC', 'gcccggttt', 'reverse_complement')
```

```filter_fastq``` input accept a dictionary {Sequence name: (read, read quality symbols)}. Example:
```
EXAMPLE_FASTQ = {
    '@SRX079801': ('ACAGCAACATAAACATGA....AA', 'FGGGFGGGFGGGFG...GGD'),
    '@SRX079802': ('ATTA...TG', 'BFFFFFFFB@B@A<@D>BDDACDDDEBEDEFFFBFFFEFFDFFF=CC@DDFD8FFFFFFF8/+.2,@7<<:?B/:<><-><@.A*C>D'),
    ...
    '@SRX079812': ('AGT...AATGACCCG', '<98;...BBC')
    }      
```
As well as thresholds in length, gc composition, and read phread quality control.
example:
```python
filter_fastq(
        seqs: EXAMPLE_FASTQ,
        gc_bounds=44,
        length_bounds=(10000, 100000), quality_threshold=34):
```
Output will be the dict with same structure, but contains only sequences which pass the threshold

Questions, comments and suggestions can be asked/suggested in the issues tab.P.S. 
We often receive question:
 Do we know anything about the Bio.SeqIO package?
 Our response:
 We've never heard of it. :)
